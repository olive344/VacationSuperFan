# VacationSuperFan
Designed and built a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JS to create a site where the user will click a present and find out where they will be going on their next "vacation". Throughout this experience they will be emerged in the culture! My process is documented here to show how I designed the site and how I used user feedback to improve.
